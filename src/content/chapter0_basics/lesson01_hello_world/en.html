  Here is a tiny program that prints out the text "Hello, Joe!". We'll explain
  how it works shortly.

<p>
  In a normal Gleam project this program would be run using the command
  <code>gleam run</code> on the command line, but here in this tour the program
  is compiled and run inside your web browser, allowing you to try Gleam without
  installing anything on your computer.

  Try changing the text being printed to <code>Hello, Mike!</code> and see what
  happens.
