<p>Here is a program that prints out the text "Hello, Joe!".</p>
<p>
  It does this by using the <code>println</code> function which has been
  imported from the
  <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/io.html"
    ><code>gleam/io</code></a
  >
  <i>module</i>.
  We'll talk more about modules in the next section;
  for now, think of it as a place to hold functions like <code>println</code>.
</p>
<p>
  In a normal Gleam program this program would be run using the command
  <code>gleam run</code> on the command line, but here in this tour the program
  is automatically compiled and run as the code is edited.
</p>
<p>
  Try changing the text being printed to <code>Hello, Mike!</code> and see what
  happens.
