  Gleam code is organized into units called <em>modules</em>. A module is a
  bunch of definitions (of types, functions, etc.) that seem to belong together.
  For example, the 
  <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/io.html" target="_blank">
    <code>gleam/io</code>
  </a> 
  module contains a variety of functions for printing, like 
  <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/io.html#println" target="_blank">
    <code>println</code>
  </a>.
</p>
<p>
  All gleam code is in <i>some</i> module or other, whose name comes from the
  name of the file it's in. For example, 
  <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/io.html" target="_blank">
    <code>gleam/io</code>
  </a> 
  is in a file called <code>io.gleam</code> in a directory called <code>gleam</code>.
</p>
<p>
  For code in one module to access code in another module, we import it using
  the <code>import</code> keyword, and the name used to refer to it is the last
  part of the module name. For example, the 
  <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/io.html" target="_blank">
    <code>gleam/io</code>
  </a> 
  module is referred to as <code>io</code> once imported.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>as</code> keyword can be used to refer to a module by a different
  name. See how the 
  <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/string.html" target="_blank">
    <code>gleam/string</code>
  </a> 
  module is referred to as <code>text</code> here.
