  Gleam code is organized into units called "modules."
  A module is a bunch of definitions (of types, functions, etc.) 
  that seem to belong together. For example, the
  <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/io.html">
    <code>gleam/io</code>
  </a>
  module contains a variety of functions for printing, like <code>println</code>.
</p>
<p>
  All gleam code is in <i>some</i> module or other, 
  whose name comes from the name of the file it's in.
  For example, <code>gleam/io</code> is in a file called <code>io.gleam</code> 
  in a directory called <code>gleam</code>.
</p>
<p>
  For code in one module to access code in another module, 
  we import it using the <code>import</code> keyword, 
  as seen here and in the last section.
</p>
<p>
  There are two ways to import code, called "qualified" and "unqualified."
  Normally functions from other modules are used in a qualified fashion, with
  the name of the module, then a dot, then the the function name. For example,
  <code>io.println("Hello!")</code>.
  The <code>io</code> bit here is called a module "qualifier."
</p>
<p>
  It is also possible to specify a list of functions to import from a module in
  an unqualified fashion, such as the <code>println</code> function in the code
  editor now. Because it has been imported like this it can be referred to as just
  <code>println</code>, with no module qualifier in front.
</p>
<p>
  Generally it is best to use qualified imports, as this makes it clear where
  the function is defined, making the code easier to read.
