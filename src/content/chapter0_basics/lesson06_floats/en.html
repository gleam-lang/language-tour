<p>Gleam's <code>Float</code> type represents numbers that are not integers.</p>
<p>
  Gleam's numerical operators are not overloaded, so there are dedicated
  operators for working with floats.
</p>
<p>
  Floats are represented as 64 bit floating point numbers on both the Erlang and
  JavaScript runtimes. The floating point behaviour is native to their
  respective runtimes, so their exact behaviour will be slightly different
  on the two runtimes.
</p>
<p>
  Under the JavaScript runtime, exceeding the maximum (or minimum) representable
  value for a floating point value will result in <code>Infinity</code> (or
  <code>-Infinity</code>). Should you try to divide two infinities, you will
  get <code>NaN</code> as a result.
</p>
<p>
  When running on the BEAM, any overflow will raise an error. So there is
  no <code>NaN</code> or <code>Infinity</code> float value in the Erlang
  runtime.
</p>
<p>
  Division by zero will not overflow, but is instead defined to be zero.

  standard library module contains functions for working with floats.
