<p>
  Gleam has the <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code> operators for checking
  equality.
</p>
<p>
  The operators can be used with values of any type, but both sides of the
  operator must be of the same type.
</p>
<p>
  Equality is checked <em>structurally</em>, meaning that two values are equal
  if they have the same structure, rather than if they are at the same memory
  location.
