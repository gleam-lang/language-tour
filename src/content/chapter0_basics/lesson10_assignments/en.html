<p>A value can be assigned to a variable using <code>let</code>.</p>
<p>
  Variable names can be reused by later let bindings, but the values they
  reference are immutable, so the values themselves are not changed or mutated
  in any way.
</p>
<p>
  In Gleam variable and function names are written in <code>snake_case</code>.
