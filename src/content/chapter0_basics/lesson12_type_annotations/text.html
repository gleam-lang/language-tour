<p>
  Let assignments can be written with a type annotation after the name.
</p>
<p>
  Type annotations may be useful for documentation purposes, but they do not
  change how Gleam type checks the code beyond ensuring that the annotation is
  correct.
</p>
<p>
  Typically Gleam code will not have type annotations for assignments.
</p>
<p>
  Try changing a type annotation to something incorrect to see the compile
  error.
