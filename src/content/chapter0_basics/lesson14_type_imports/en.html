  Other modules may also define types that we wish to refer to. In this case we
  need to import them.
</p>
<p>
  Like functions, types can be referred to in a <em>qualified</em> way by
  putting the imported module name and a dot before the type name. For example,
  <a
    href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/bytes_tree.html#BytesTree"
    target="_blank"
  >
    <code>bytes_tree.BytesTree</code>
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  Types can also be imported in an <em>unqualified</em> way by listing them in
  the import statement with the word <code>type</code> before the type name.
</p>
<p>
  Unlike functions, Gleam types are commonly imported in an unqualified way.
