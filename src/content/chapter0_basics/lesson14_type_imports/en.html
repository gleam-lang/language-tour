<p>
  Other modules may also define types that we wish to refer to. In this case we
  need to import them.
</p>
<p>
  Like functions types can be referred to in a <em>qualified</em> way by putting
  the imported module name and a dot before the type name. For example, 
  <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/bytes_builder.html#BytesBuilder" target="_blank">
    <code>bytes_builder.BytesBuilder</code>
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  Types can also be imported in an <em>unqualified</em> way by listing them in
  the import statement with the word <code>type</code> before the type name.
</p>
<p>
  It is more common in Gleam code for types to be imported in an unqualified way
  than it is for functions to be imported in an unqualified way.
