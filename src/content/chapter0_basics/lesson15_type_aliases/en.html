  A type alias can be used to refer to a type by a different name. Giving a type
  an alias doesn't make a new type, it is still the same type.
</p>
<p>
  A type's name always starts with a capital letter, contrasting to variables
  and functions, which start with a lowercase letter.

<p>
  When the <code>pub</code> keyword is used the type alias is public and can be
  referred to by other modules.
