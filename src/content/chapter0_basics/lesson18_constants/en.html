<p>
  As well as let assignments, Gleam also has constants, which are defined at the
  top level of a module.
</p>
<p>
  Constants must be literal values; functions cannot be used in their
  definitions.
</p>
<p>
  Constants may be useful for values that are used throughout your program,
  permitting them to be named and to ensure there are no differences in the
  definition between each use.
</p>
<p>
  Using a constant may be more efficient than creating the same value in
  multiple functions, though the exact performance characteristics will depend
  on the runtime and whether compiling to Erlang or JavaScript.
