  The <code>fn</code> keyword is used to define new functions.
</p>
<p>
  Similar to blocks, each expression in the function body is evaluated in order
  and the value of the last expression is returned from the function. Gleam is
  an expression based language so there is no <code>return</code> operator, but
  there are ways to conditionally return early from a function, which will be
  introduced in a later section.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>double</code> and <code>multiply</code> functions are defined
  without the <code>pub</code> keyword. This makes them <em>private</em>
  functions, they can only be used within this module. If another module
  attempted to use them it would result in a compiler error.
</p>
<p>
  Like with assignments, type annotations are optional for function arguments
  and return values. It is considered good practice to use type annotations for
  functions, for clarity and to encourage intentional and thoughtful design.
