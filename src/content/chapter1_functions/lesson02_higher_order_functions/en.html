  In Gleam, functions are values. They can be assigned to variables, passed to
  other functions, and anything else you can do with values.

  Here the function <code>add_one</code> is being passed as an argument to the
  <code>twice</code> function.

  Notice the <code>fn</code> keyword is also used to describe the type of the
  function that <code>twice</code> takes as its second argument.
