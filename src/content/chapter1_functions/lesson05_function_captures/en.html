<p>
  Gleam has a shorthand syntax for creating anonymous functions that take one
  argument and immediately call another function with that argument: the
  function capture syntax.
</p>
<p>
  The anonymous function <code>fn(a) { some_function(..., a, ...) }</code> can
  be written as <code>some_function(..., _, ...)</code>, with any number of
  other arguments passed to the inner function. The underscore <code>_</code> is
  a placeholder for the argument, equivalent to <code>a</code> in 
  <code>fn(a) { some_function(..., a, ...) }</code>.
