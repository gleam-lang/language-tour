<p>
  Up until now each function has accepted precisely one type for each of its
  arguments.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>twice</code> function in the previous lesson on
  <i>higher order functions</i> only worked with functions that would take and
  return ints. This is overly restrictive, it should be possible to use this
  function with any type, so long as the function and the initial value are
  compatible.
</p>
<p>
  To enable this Gleam support <em>generics</em>, also known as
  <em>parametric polymorphism</em>.
</p>
<p>
  This works by using a type variable istead of specifying a concrete type. It
  stands in for whatever specific type is being used when the function is
  called. These type variables are written with a lowercase name.
</p>
<p>
  Type variables are not like an <code>any</code> type, they get replaced with a
  specific type each time the function is called. Try uncommenting
  <code>twice(10, exclaim)</code> to see the compiler error from trying to use a
  type variable as an int and a string at the same time.
