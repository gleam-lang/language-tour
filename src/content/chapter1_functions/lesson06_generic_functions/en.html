<p>
  Up until now each function has accepted precisely one type for each of its
  arguments.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>twice</code> function in the previous lesson only
  worked with functions that would take and return ints. This is
  overly restrictive. It should be possible to use this function with any type,
  so long as the function and the initial value are compatible.
</p>
<p>
  To enable this Gleam support <em>generics</em>, also known as
  <em>parametric polymorphism</em>.
</p>
<p>
  This works by instead of specifying a concrete type, a type variable is used
  which stands in for whatever specific type is being used when the function is
  called. These type variables are written with a lowercase name.
</p>
<p>
  Type variables are not like an <code>any</code> type, they get replaced with a
  specific type each time the function is called. Try uncommenting
  <code>twice(10, exclaim)</code> to see the compiler error from trying to use a
  type variable as an int and a string at the same time.
