  When functions take several arguments it can be difficult to remember what the
  arguments are, and what order they are expected in.
</p>
<p>
  To help with this Gleam supports labelled arguments, where function arguments
  are given an external label in addition to their internal name. These labels
  are written before the argument name in the function definition.
</p>
<p>
  When labelled arguments are used the order of the arguments does not matter,
  but all unlabelled arguments must come before labelled arguments.
</p>
<p>
  There is no performance cost to using labelled arguments, it does not allocate
  a dictionary or perform any other runtime work.
</p>
<p>
  Labels are optional when calling a function, it is up to the programmer to
  decide what is clearest in their code.
