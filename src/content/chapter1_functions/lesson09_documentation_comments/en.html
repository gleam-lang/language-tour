  Documentation and comments are important tools for making your code easier to
  work with and understand.
</p>
<p>
  As well as regular <code>//</code> comments Gleam has <code>///</code> and
  <code>////</code> comments which are used for attaching documentation to code.
</p>
<p>
  <code>///</code> is used for documenting types and functions, and should be
  placed immediately before the type or function it is documenting.
</p>
<p>
  <code>////</code> is used for documenting modules, and should be placed
  at the top of the module.
