<p>
  Gleam v1.4.0 introduced the _label shorthand_, a more concise syntax for using
  a variable with a label of the same name.
</p>
<p>
  To use it omit the name of the variable to the right on the `:` for the label.
</p>
<p>
  For example, `document(title:, content:)` is the same as `document(title:
  title, content: content)`.
