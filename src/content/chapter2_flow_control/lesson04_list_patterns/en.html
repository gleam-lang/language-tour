<p>
  Lists and the values they contain can be pattern matched on in case
  expressions.
</p> 
<p>
  List patterns match on specific lengths of lists. The pattern <code>[]</code>
  matches an empty list, and the pattern <code>[_]</code> matches a list with
  one element. They will not match on lists with other lengths.
</p>
<p>
  The spread pattern <code>..</code> can be used to match the rest of the list.
  The pattern <code>[1, ..]</code> matches any list that starts with
  <code>1</code>. The pattern <code>[_, _, ..]</code> matches any list that has
  at least two elements. By adding a variable name after the <code>..</code>, you
  can capture the remaining elements of the list. The pattern <code>[_, ..rest]</code>
  will match a list with at least one element and assign the rest of the elements
  to the variable <code>rest</code>.
