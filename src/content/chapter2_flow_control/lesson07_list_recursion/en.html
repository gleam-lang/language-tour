<p>
  While it is more common to use functions in the
  <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/list.html" target="_blank">
    <code>gleam/list</code>
  </a>
  module to iterate across a list, at times you may prefer to work
  with the list directly.
</p>
<p>
  By using the <code>[first, ..rest]</code> pattern and a pattern for the empty
  list <code>[]</code> a function can run code on each element of a list until
  the end is reached.
</p>
<p>
  This code sums a list by recursing over the list and adding each int to a
  <code>total</code> argument, returning it when the end is reached.
