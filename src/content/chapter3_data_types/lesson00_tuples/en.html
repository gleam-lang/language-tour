<p>
  Lists are good for when we want a collection of one type, but sometimes we
  want to combine multiple values of different types. In this case tuples are a
  quick and convenient option.
</p>
<p>
  The tuple access syntax can be used to get elements from a tuple without
  pattern matching. <code>some_tuple.0</code> gets the first element,
  <code>some_tuple.1</code> gets the second element, etc.
</p>
<p>
  Tuples are generic types, they have type parameters for the types they
  contain. <code>#(1, "Hi!")</code> has the type <code>#(Int, String)</code>,
  and <code>#(1.4, 10, 48)</code> has the type <code>#(Float, Int, Int)</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Tuples are most commonly used to return 2 or 3 values from a function. Often
  it is clearer to use a <em>custom type</em> where a tuple could be used. We
  will cover custom types next.
