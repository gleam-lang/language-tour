<p>
  Gleam has a few built in types such as <code>Int</code> and
  <code>String</code>, but custom types allow the creation of entirely new
  types.
</p>
<p>
  A custom type is defined with the <code>type</code> keyword followed by the
  name of the type and a constructor for each <em>variant</em> of the type. Both
  the type name and the names of the constructors start with uppercase letters.
</p>
<p>Custom type variants can be pattern matched on using a case expression.</p>
