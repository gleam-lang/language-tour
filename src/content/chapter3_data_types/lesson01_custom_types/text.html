<p>
  Gleam has a few built in types such as <code>Int</code>, <code>String</code>,
  but custom types allow the creation of entirely new types.
</p>
<p>
  A custom type is defined with the <code>type</code> keyword followed by a
  constructor for each <em>variant</em> of the type.
</p>
<p>Custom type variants can be pattern matched on using a case expression.</p>
