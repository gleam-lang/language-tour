<p>
  The record accessor syntax <code>record.field_label</code> can be used to get
  contained values from a custom type record.
</p>
<p>
  The accessor syntax can always be used for fields with the same name that are
  in the same position and have the same type for all variants of the custom
  type. Other fields can only be accessed when the compiler can tell which
  variant the value is, such after pattern matching in a <code>case</code> expression.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>name</code> field is in the first position and has type
  <code>String</code> for all variants, so it can be accessed.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>subject</code> field is absent on the <code>Student</code> variant,
  so it cannot be used on all values of type <code>SchoolPerson</code>.
  Uncomment the <code>student.subject</code> line to see the compile error from
  trying to use this accessor.
