<p>
  The record accessor syntax <code>record.field_label</code> can be used to get
  contained values from a custom type record.
</p>
<p>
  The accessor syntax can only be used for fields with the same name that are in
  the same position and have the same type for all variants of the custom type.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>name</code> field is in the first position and has type
  <code>String</code> for all variants, so it can be accessed.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>subject</code> field is absent on the <code>Student</code> variant,
  so it cannot be used on any variant of type <code>SchoolPerson</code>.
  Uncomment the <code>teacher.subject</code> line to see the compile error from
  trying to use this accessor.
