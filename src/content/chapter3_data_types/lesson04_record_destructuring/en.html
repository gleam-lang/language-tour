  Record destructuring is syntax that allows the extraction of multiple field values 
  from a record into distinct variables in a concise and efficient way.
</p>
<p>
  To destructure a record without the use more rigorous pattern matching, 
  all variants of the record must have the same arity and each field must have the same type.
</p>
<p>
  It is possible to use underscore <code>_</code> or the spread syntax <code>..</code> to 
  discard fields that are not required.
