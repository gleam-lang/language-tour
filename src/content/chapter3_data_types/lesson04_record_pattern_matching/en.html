  It is possible to pattern match on a record, this allows for the extraction 
  of multiple field values from a record into distinct variables, similar to matching on a tuple or a list.

  The let key word can only match on single variant custom types. For types with more variants 
  a case expression must be used.

  It is possible to use underscore <code>_</code> or the spread syntax <code>..</code> to 
  discard fields that are not required.
