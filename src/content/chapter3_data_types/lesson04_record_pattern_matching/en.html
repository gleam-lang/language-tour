  It is possible to pattern match on a record, this allows for the extraction of
  multiple field values from a record into distinct variables, similar to
  matching on a tuple or a list.

<p>
  The <code>let</code> keyword can only match on single variant custom types, or
  when the variant is known, such as after pattern matching with a case
  expression.
</p>
<p>
  It is possible to use underscore <code>_</code> or the spread syntax
  <code>..</code> to discard fields that are not required.
