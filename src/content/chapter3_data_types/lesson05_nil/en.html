<p>
  <code>Nil</code> is Gleam's unit type. It is a value that is returned by
  functions that have nothing else to return, as all functions must return
  something.
</p>
<p>
  <code>Nil</code> is not a valid value of any other types, that is values in
  Gleam are not nullable. If the type of a value is <code>Nil</code> then it is
  the value <code>Nil</code>. If it is some other type then the value is not
  <code>Nil</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Uncomment the line that assigns <code>Nil</code> to a variable with an
  incompatible type annotation to see the compile time error it produces.
