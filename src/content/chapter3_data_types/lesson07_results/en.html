  Gleam doesn't use exceptions, instead computations that can either succeed or
  fail return a value of the built-in <code>Result(value, error)</code> type. It
  has two variants:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>Ok</code>, which contains the return value of a successful
    computation.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>Error</code>, which contains the reason for a failed computation.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The type is generic with two type parameters, one for the success value and
  one for the error. With these the result can hold any type for success and
  failure.
</p>
<p>
  Commonly a Gleam program or library will define a custom type with a variant
  for each possible problem that can arise, along with any error information
  that would be useful to the programmer.
</p>
<p>
  This is advantageous over exceptions as you can immediately see what if any
  errors a function can return, and the compiler will ensure they are handled.
  No nasty surprises with unexpected exceptions!
</p>
<p>
  A result value can be handled by pattern matching with a
  <code>case</code> expression, but given how frequently results are returned
  this can become unwieldy. Gleam code commonly uses the 
  <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/result.html" target="_blank">
    <code>gleam/result</code>
  </a> 
  standard library module and <code>use</code> expressions when working with results, 
  both of which will be covered in later chapters.
