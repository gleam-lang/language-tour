<p>
  The Gleam standard library is a regular Gleam package that has been published
  to the <a href="https://hex.pm">Hex</a> package repository. You could opt to
  not use it if you wish, though almost all Gleam projects depend on it.

  All of the modules imported so far in this guide, such as 
  <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/io.html" target="_blank">
    <code>gleam/io</code>
  </a>, 
  are from the standard library.
</p>
<p>
  All of the documentation for the standard library is available on
  <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/">HexDocs</a>. We will go over some
  of the most commonly used modules now.
