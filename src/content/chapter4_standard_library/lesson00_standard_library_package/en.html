<p>
  The Gleam standard library is a regular Gleam package that has been published
  to the <a href="https://hex.pm">Hex</a> package repository. You could opt to
  not use it if you wish, though almost all Gleam projects depend on it.

<p>
  All of the modules imported so far in this guide, such as
  <code>gleam/io</code>, are from the standard library.
</p>
<p>
  All of the documentation for the standard library is available on
  <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/">HexDocs</a>. We will go over some
  of the most commonly used modules now.
