  The
  <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/result.html" target="_blank">
    <code>gleam/result</code>
  </a>
  standard library module contains functions for working with results. Gleam
  programs will make heavy use of this module to avoid excessive nested case
  expressions when calling multiple functions that can fail.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/result.html#map" target="_blank">
    <code>map</code>
  </a>
  updates a value held within the Ok of a result by calling a given function on
  it. If the result is an error then the function is not called.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/result.html#try" target="_blank">
    <code>try</code>
  </a>
  runs a result returning function on the value held within an Ok of a result.
  If the result is an error then the function is not called. This is useful for
  chaining together multiple function calls that can fail, one after the other,
  stopping at the first error.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/result.html#unwrap" target="_blank">
    <code>unwrap</code>
  </a>
  extracts the success value from a result, or returning a default value if the
  result is an error.
</p>

<p>
  Result functions are often used with pipelines to chain together multiple
  calls to result returning functions.
