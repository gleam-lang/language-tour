<p>
  The
  <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/dict.html"
    ><code>gleam/dict</code></a
  >
  standard library module defines Gleam's <code>Dict</code> type and functions
  for working with it. A dict is a collection of keys and values which other
  languages may call a hashmap or table.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/dict.html#new"
    ><code>new</code></a
  >
  and
  <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/dict.html#from_list"
    ><code>new</code></a
  >
  can be used to create new dicts.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/dict.html#insert"
    ><code>insert</code></a
  >
  and
  <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/dict.html#delete"
    ><code>delete</code></a
  >
  are used to add and remove items from a dict.
</p>
<p>
  Like lists, dicts are immutable. Inserting or deleting an item from a dict
  will return a new dict with the item added or removed.
</p>
<p>
  Dicts are unordered! If it appears that the items in a dict are in a certain
  order this is incidental and should not be relied upon. Any ordering may
  change without warning in future versions or on different runtimes.
