<p>
  Values in Gleam are not nullable, so the
  <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/option.html"
    ><code>gleam/option</code></a
  >
  standard library module defines Gleam's <code>Option</code> type, which can be
  used to represent a value that is either present or absent.
</p>

<p>
  The option type is very similar to the result type, but it does not have an
  error value. Some languages have functions return an option when there is no
  extra error detail to give, but Gleam always uses result. This makes all
  fallible functions consistent and removes any boilerplate that would be
  required when mixing functions that use each type.
