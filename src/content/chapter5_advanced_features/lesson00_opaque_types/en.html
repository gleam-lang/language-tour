<p>
  <em>Opaque types</em> are types where a custom type itself is public and can
  be used by other modules, but the constructors for the type are private and
  can only be used by the module that defines the type. This prevents other
  modules from constructing or pattern matching on the type.
</p>
<p>
  This is useful for creating types with <em>smart constructors</em>. A smart
  constructor is a function that constructs a value of a type, but is more
  restrictive than if the programmer were to use one of the type's constructors
  directly. This can be useful for ensuring that the type is used correctly.
</p>
<p>
  For example, this <code>PositiveInt</code> custom type is opaque, so if other
  modules want to construct one they have to use the <code>new</code> function,
  which ensures that the integer is positive.
