  The <code>todo</code> keyword is used to specify that some code is not yet
  implemented.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>as "some string"</code> is optional, though you may wish to include
  the message if you have more than one code block marked as
  <code>todo</code> in your code.
</p>
<p>
  When used the Gleam compiler will print a warning to remind you the code is
  unfinished, and if the code is run then the program will crash with the given
  message.
