  The <code>panic</code> keyword is similar to the <code>todo</code> keyword,
  but it's used to crash the program when the program has reached a point that

  This keyword should almost never be used! It may be useful in initial
  prototypes and scripts, but its use in a library or production application is
  a sign that the design could be improved. With well designed types the type
  system can typically be used to make these invalid states unrepresentable.
