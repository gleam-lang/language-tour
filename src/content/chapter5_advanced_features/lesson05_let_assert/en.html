  <code>let assert</code> is another way to intentionally crash your Gleam
  program. It is similar to the <code>panic</code> keyword in that it crashes
  when the program has reached a point that should never be reached.

  <code>let assert</code> is similar to <code>let</code> in that it is a way to
  assign values to variables, but it is different in that the pattern can be
  <i>partial</i>. The pattern does not need to match every possible value of the
  type being assigned.
</p>
<p>
  Just like <code>panic</code> and <code>todo</code>, the <code>as</code> keyword
  can be used with <code>let assert</code> to supply a custom panic message if
  the pattern fails to match and the program crashes.
</p>
<p>
  Like <code>panic</code> this feature should be used sparingly, and likely not
  at all in libraries.
