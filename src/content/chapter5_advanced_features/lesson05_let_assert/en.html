  <code>let assert</code> is the final way to intentionally crash your Gleam
  program. It's similar to the <code>panic</code> keyword in that it crashes
  when the program has reached a point that should never be reached.

  <code>let assert</code> is similar to <code>let</code> in that it's a way to
  assign values to variables, but it's different in that the pattern can be
  <i>partial</i>. The pattern does not need to match every possible value of the
  type being assigned.

  Like <code>panic</code> this feature should be used sparingly, and likely not
  at all in libraries.
