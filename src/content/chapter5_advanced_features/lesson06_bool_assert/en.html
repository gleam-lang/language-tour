<p>
  Bool <code>assert</code> is similar to <code>let assert</code>, except
  instead of asserting that a value matches a specific pattern, it asserts
  that a boolean value evaluates to <code>True</code>.

<p>
  Bool <code>assert</code> is best suited for making assertions in test code,
  as panicking is usually not the correct way to handle errors in Gleam, especially
  in libraries.
