  Bool <code>assert</code> is the final way to cause a panic in Gleam, used for
  writing test assertions. It is similar to <code>let assert</code>, except instead
  of asserting that a value matches a specific pattern, it asserts that a boolean
  value evaluates to <code>True</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Like the other panicking keywords, the <code>as</code> keyword can be used to
  add a custom message to an assertion. This will be shown instead of the generic
  "Assertion failed" message if the value evaluates to <code>False</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Bool <code>assert</code> is designed to be used in test code, and should almost
  never be used in applications or libraries.
