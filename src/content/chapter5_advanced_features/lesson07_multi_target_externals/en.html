<p>
  Multiple external implementations can be specified for the same function,
  enabling the function to work on both Erlang and JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
  If a function doesn't have an implementation for the currently compiled-for
  target then the compiler will return an error.
</p>
<p>
  You should try to implement functions for all targets, but this isn't always
  possible due to incompatibilities in how IO and concurreny works in Erlang and
  JavaScript. With Erlang concurrent IO is handled transparently by the runtime,
  while in JavaScript concurrent IO requires the use of promises or callbacks.
  If your code uses the Erlang style it is typically not possible to implement
  in JavaScript, while if callbacks are used then it won't be compatible with
  most Gleam and Erlang code as it forces any code that calls the function to
  also use callbacks.
</p>
<p>
  Libraries that make use of concurrent IO will typically have to decide whether
  they support Erlang or JavaScript, and document this in their README.
