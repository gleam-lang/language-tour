  It's possible for a function to have both a Gleam implementation and an
  external implementation. If there exists an external implementation for the
  currently compiled-for target then it will be used, otherwise the Gleam
  implementation is used.

<p>
  This may be useful if you have a function that can be implemented in Gleam,
  but there is an optimised implementation that can be used for one target. For
  example, the Erlang virtual machine has a built-in list reverse function that
  is implemented in native code. The code here uses this implementation when
  running on Erlang, as it is then available.
